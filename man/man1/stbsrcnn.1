.SH DESCRIPTION
Image Super-Resolution using Convolutional Neural Network.

\fBSRCNN\fR is a Implementation of Image Super-Resolution using SRCNN which is proposed by Chao Dong in 2014.

 - If you want to find the details of SRCNN algorithm, please read the paper:
   Chao Dong, Chen Change Loy, Kaiming He, Xiaoou Tang. Learning a Deep Convolutional Network for Image Super-Resolution, in Proceedings of European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014
 - If you want to download the training code(caffe) or test code(Matlab) for SRCNN, please [open your browse and visit](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/SRCNN.html) for more details.
 - And thank you very much for Chao's work in SRCNN.
